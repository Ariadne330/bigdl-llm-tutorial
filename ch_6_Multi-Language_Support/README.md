# Chapter 6 Multi-Language Support

This chapter explores the capability of large languange models in handling multiple languages. Being able to support multiple languages is crucial for these models due to their wide-ranging use cases and real-world applications. 

Many popular models have support for multiple languages, such as: [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), [ChatGLM](https://chatglm.cn/blog), [Baichuan](https://huggingface.co/baichuan-inc/Baichuan-13B-Chat), [Llama](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/llama), etc.


We provide two notebooks showing the usage of two popular multi-language models, using Chinese capabilities for illustration.
