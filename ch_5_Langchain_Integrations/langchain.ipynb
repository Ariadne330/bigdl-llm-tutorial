    "# Notebook 5: Langchain Integrations \n",
    "\n",
    "[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html) is a popular library for developing applications powered by language models. You can use LangChain with LLMs to build various interesting applications such as [Chatbot](https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL/blob/main/python/llm/example/langchain/transformers_int4/chat.py), [Document Q&A](https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL/blob/main/python/llm/example/langchain/transformers_int4/docqa.py), [voice assistant](https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL/blob/main/python/llm/example/langchain/transformers_int4/voiceassistant.py). BigDL-LLM provides LangChain integrations (i.e. LLM wrappers and embeddings) and you can use them the same way as [other LLM wrappers in LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/). \n",

       "' Understanding Artificial Intelligence\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field of technology that is transforming the way we live and work. It is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. AI is a combination of various techniques from computer science, mathematics, and engineering.\\nThe goal of AI is to create machines that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as recognizing speech, understanding natural language, making decisions, and solving problems. AI can be used in a wide range of applications, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment.\\nThere are several types of AI, including:\\n1. Narrow or weak AI: This type of AI is designed to perform a specific task, such as image recognition or language translation.\\n2. General or strong AI: This type of AI is designed to perform a wide range of tasks, but it is not yet possible to create a general AI that can perform all tasks that a human can.\\n3. Superintelligent AI: This type of AI is designed to be much smarter than the average human, and it has the potential to revolutionize society.\\n4. Artificial narrow intelligence (ANI): This type of AI is designed to perform a specific task, such as image recognition or language translation.\\n5. Artificial general intelligence (AGI): This type of AI is designed to perform a wide range of tasks, but it is not yet possible to create a general AI that can perform all tasks that a human can.\\n6. Artificial superintelligence (ASI): This type of AI is designed to be much smarter than the average human, and it has the potential to revolutionize society.\\nThere are several ways to classify AI, including:\\n1. Top-down: This approach starts with a high-level understanding of the problem and works its way down to the details.\\n2. Bottom-up: This approach starts with the details of the problem and works its way up to the high-level understanding.\\n3. Hybrid: This approach combines the top-down and bottom-up approaches.\\n4. Goal-oriented: This approach is designed to achieve a specific goal, such as recognizing speech or playing chess.\\n5. Data-driven: This approach is designed to learn from data, such as images or text.\\n6. Model-based: This approach is designed to use a model to make predictions or decisions.\\n7. Learning-based: This approach is designed to learn from data, such as images or text.\\n8. Optimization-based: This approach is designed to optimize a specific objective function, such as minimizing the error in a prediction.\\n9. Reasoning-based: This approach is designed to reason about the world, such as understanding natural language or playing chess.\\n10. Natural Language Processing (NLP): This approach is designed to process and understand human language, such as speech or text.\\n11. Computer Vision: This approach is designed to process and understand images, such as recognizing objects or faces.\\n12. Robotics: This approach is designed to control physical robots, such as robots in manufacturing or healthcare.\\n13. Expert Systems: This approach is designed to simulate the decision-making process of a human expert, such as a doctor or a lawyer.\\n14. Machine Learning (ML): This approach is designed to learn from data, such as images or text, and make predictions or decisions.\\n15. Deep Learning (DL): This approach is designed to use deep neural networks to learn from data, such as images or text.\\n16. Reinforcement Learning (RL): This approach is designed to learn from rewards and punishments, such as playing a game or controlling a robot.\\n17. Generative Models: This approach is designed to generate new data that is similar to the training data, such as images or text.\\n18. Discriminative Models: This approach is designed to classify data into different categories, such as recognizing speech or playing chess.\\n19. Transfer Learning: This approach is designed to use pre-trained models to learn new tasks, such as recognizing speech or playing chess.\\n20. Explainable AI (XAI): This approach is designed to make the decision-making process of AI more transparent and understandable to humans.\\n21. Ethical AI: This approach is designed to ensure that AI is used in a responsible and ethical manner, such as avoiding bias or protecting privacy.\\n22. Secure AI: This approach is designed to'"
