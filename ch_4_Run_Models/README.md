# Chapter 3 Run Models

This chapter will introduce you to the detailed usage of the BigDL-LLM `transformers`-style API. Based on that, we will create various applications, including a stream chatbot and a speech recognition system.

In the notebook [4_1_Run_Transformer_Models](./4_1_Run_Transformer_Models.ipynb), you will explore different use cases for loading *transformers* models with BigDL-LLM low-precision optimizations. Building on this knowledge, we will proceed to build a chatbot application.

Moving on to the notebook [4_2_Speech_Recognition](./4_2_Speech_Recognition.ipynb), we will focus on applying BigDL-LLM low-precision optimizations to a Transformer-based speech recognition model called [Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper). Based on that, we will develop an application to transcribe and translate audio files.
